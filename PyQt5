1. Signal transfer with parameters.
  Solution 1: 
    using lambda.
      e.g. connect(lambda self.fun(p1))
    but this method doesn't work well in loops.
  Solution 2:
    using functools.partial.
      e.g. from functools import partial
           connect(partial(self.fun(p1))
    can be used in loops.
      e.g. for i in xxx:
              connect(partial(self.fun(i))
